# Question 5: The Fleet Arrives

NASA Long Range telescopes have made an alarming observation: a seemingly infinite fleet of UFOs are expected to begin arriving within 2 years. Congress, in an exceptionally rare moment of bipartisanship, has passed an appropriation allocating $5m dollars for the formal establishment of the Center for the Strategic Tactical Ufo & Planetary Identification Database.  With need for near limitless scale, and a budget to match, your assignment is draft an overview of the core architecture for the system to be built.

The core requirements you've been provided for the system are:

* The ability to ingest and store 100's of thousands or more sightings per second
* The ability to enrich raw sighting data with additional data from other systems
* The ability to trigger alerts in Dept. of Defense systems when sightings matching conditions are reported
* Existing reporting functionality must continue to be supported

Fortunately, your new shadowy bosses are pragmatic, and understand that some trade-offs will be necessary when building the system.  They expect you to identify these tradeoffs, make decisions, and defend the decisions you've made.
